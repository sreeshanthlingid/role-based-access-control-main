The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) project is a web application designed to manage user roles and permissions effectively. It follows a modular architecture, including components for defining user roles, handling routes, and implementing dynamic web page rendering. The project incorporates static assets for styling and interactivity, as well as dynamic templates for generating user-facing content. Utilities and helper functions are used to streamline core functionalities, while the application's configuration supports environment-specific setups and development automation. Dependencies and scripts are managed efficiently to ensure smooth operation and extensibility. This project provides a robust framework for securely controlling access based on user roles in a scalable and maintainable way.
